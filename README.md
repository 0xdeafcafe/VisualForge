VisualForge
===========

Open a usermap (sandbox only atm), and it'll load the assets that you have placed in forge and load them into a 3D XNA game enviroment.

If I ever get round to working on this again, I'll get it to load from a cache file (smaller exe size), and then obviously support more than just sandbox.
