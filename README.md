VisualForge
===========

Open a usermap (sandbox only at-the-moment), and it will load the asset placement information from the forge variant, and render an exact replica in the game view. It currently loads the assets from a folder in the same directory as the exe.

If I ever work on this again, I'll update it to load assets from the actual Blam cache file (.maps). For legal reasons. And also application size issues. (What is this, [Vanity](http://veegie.com/Vanity/ "Vanity, by Veegie of Bungie")?)
